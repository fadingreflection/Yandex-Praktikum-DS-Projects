Yandex.Music: Identifying Preferences of Moscow and St. Petersburg Users|  Having data about the activity of users from Moscow and St. Petersburg I had to identify their preferable genres and establish listening patterns based on weekdays| Python, math, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn 
|   |   |
Borrower Reliability Analysis| Using the data of bank clients I had to identify the reliability of each one of them for further credit scoring prediction| Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, data preprocessing
|   |   |                                                                     
Real Estate Market Analysis| Case of fraud-prevention analysis where I had to identify potentially fraudful ads by studying apartment parameters in a dataset| Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, data preprocessing, data analysis
|   |   | 
Identification of a profitable mobile tariff | Based on the data provided by mobile operators, I analyzed customer behavior and found the optimal plan for the company |Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, SciPy, Statistics, Statistical Hypothesis testing, Math, Seaborn
|   |   | 
Identifying Strategy for Game Ads Development | Using historical data on computer games sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms. I have managed to reveal underlying patterns that contribute to the success of a game| Python, Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, Preprocessing data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistics, statistical hypothesis testing, Seaborn, SciPy
